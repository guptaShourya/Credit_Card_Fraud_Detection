## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a classifier to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Numpy, SKlearn, imbalance, dataprep
* Google Colab
* etc. 

## Project Description
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The dataset is taken from Kaggle. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. To work with class imbalance SMOTE, undersampling and AUPRC are used. Dataprep is used for the purpose of EDA visualisation.
